# Passenger-Satisfaction-Analysis-for-CheapSeat-Airlines
Passenger Satisfaction Analysis for CheapSeat Airlines using Linear Regression, Association Rules and SVM.
Developed methodologies for data cleaning, data wrangling and analyzing the dataset using Linear modeling, Support Vector Machines, and association rules to improve the customer's satisfaction for a particular airline using R programming.

In order to improve the satisfaction of passengers, this project investigates the data from 194,833 passenger surveys of 29 attributes. The major findings are:
•	The important demographic characteristics of the passengers
•	Influential factors which contribute to customer satisfaction
•	Impact of the arrival delay on airline customer satisfaction
•	The difference in satisfaction between different types of travelers and airline status

Business question that it tries to solve
●	Which demographics of people should we focus on to increase the overall satisfaction?
●	Is there any difference between different partner companies in customer satisfaction?
●	Is there a significant difference in customer satisfaction between different groups of age? 
●	How is the company’s service for different groups of Airline Status?
●	How does the arrival delay affect customer satisfaction?


Conclusion and Recommendation
1)	The company should improve its service for personal travelers. A large proportion of personal travelers are not satisfied with their experiences.
2)	Whether the arrival time is late for more than 5 minutes is important for customers. Specifically, as an example, while most of the personal travelers are not satisfied, Silver customers who have arrived less than 5 minutes are more likely to be satisfied. Old (more than 65 years old) business travelers or young (less than 23 years old) non-personal travelers are likely to complain about the trip if the arrival is late for more than 5 minutes. If arrival delay cannot be avoided, the airline company should take some other measures to improve customer satisfaction.
3)	While many of the middle-aged customers are satisfied with the airline’s service, old customers are more likely to report complaints about the service. The company may implement some marketing strategies for old customers to improve their satisfaction.
